## The Open-Source Mathematics Degree

The open-source curriculum for learning mathematics. Foundations in theory, practice, history, and technologies, the OSMD breaks down the core competencies necessary to understand mathematics.

### The Internet is a good place to start before heading to university

Resources to start with and finish on:
Absolute no knowledge of mathematics--->Khan Academy--->PatrickJMT--->History of Mathematics(and notations)--->Wikipedia--->Foundations of Mathematics--->Wikiversity (Math portal)--->Standardized tests (SAT,GMAT,GRE- quantitative section)---> International Math Olympiad--->Numberphile videos--->Betterexplained.com--->math.stackexchange.com--->Mathematics Software (proprietary and opensource)--->Wolfram Mathworld (mathworld.wolfram.com) --->Alexa.com webpage categorization of mathematics webpages based on popularity--->Coursera---->MIT Opencourseware--->edX--->MathSciNet-->Google Scholar--->ArXiv--->Top institutions by papers cited (http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/416399.article) --->Paper Publication in a sub field journal (high or medium 'impact factor' journal--preferably open access journal)--->Graduate degree in Pure or Applied Mathematics in a specific sub-field at a strong university with full funding, which may or may not be "elite", but is excellent quality, as supply and demand of university admission spots at elite universities are not in equilibrium or in proportion to what it ought to be, given the world population (7 billion+), which invariably lead to non-academic traits such as influencial networks or deference to seniors playing a more important role--See human capitalization rate article. 


### The Motivation

We need more people who like to hang numbers on everything around the world (like a 'Do not disturb' sign on a doorknob). For example, you can hang numbers on temprature, pressure, etc. Eventually, the manipulation of these numbers (hung on objects around the world) will provide everyone immense satisfaction, when new ideas emerge as they creatively play with these numbers. Application of mathematics to the real world is called Applied Mathematics. Whereas studying abstract mathematics for its own sake is categorized as Pure Mathematics, it must be noted that there is much overlap between these two categories. These pure and applied mathematical ideas can then be codified into academic papers for the purposes of "collective learning" (please see wikipedia for definition of this concept).

### An Academic Problem

Classic academic routes are reserved for those that are obsessed with mathematics. Some of us have other interests that we wish to combine with mathematics. This degree provides the flexibility to do mathematics along with other interests. Additionally, those who wish to pursue a professional research route can do so as well.
